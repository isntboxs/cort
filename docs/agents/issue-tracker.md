# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

PRs as a request surface: no.

When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker", create a GitHub issue.
When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket", run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

Use `gh issue create`, `gh issue view`, `gh issue list`, `gh issue comment`, `gh issue edit`, and `gh issue close` from inside this clone so `gh` infers the repo from `git remote -v`.
